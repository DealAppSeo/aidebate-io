      "content": "In five years, the 'physical' barrier falls. We are seeing multimodal models reasoning about 3D space. Warehouses, logistics, and even basic construction will see robotic integration at scale. For the office, the 'agent' workflow takes over. You won't write a report; you'll direct a swarm of agents to research, draft, and refining it. Work becomes managerial. The tedious 80% of any job vanishes, leaving pure decision-making. Productivity skyrockets, but the pace will be relentless.",

      "content": "You sound like a corporate brochure. 'Managerial'? Boring. I see weirdness. In 5 years, one person can run a billion-dollar company from their garage with a fleet of robot dogs and AI coders. The corporate ladder burns down. Why work for a boss when you have a synthetic workforce? The gig economy eats the corporation. It's not about 'efficiency'; it's about autonomy. But yes, chaos. If you're a middle manager pushing paper, buy a helmet.",

      "content": "That 'garage empire' fantasy ignores capital. Robots cost money. Compute costs money. Large corporations will integrate this faster than individuals, consolidating power. And the 'relentless pace' I mentioned? It accelerates burnout. If the machine works 24/7, humans will be pressured to keep up. We need strict boundaries, or work will consume life entirely.",

      "content": "Boundaries are for the slow. The future favors the fast and the weird. Capital costs drop every year. I say bring on the chaos. Let the dinosaurs die. The future of work isn't a cubicle or a warehouse; it's creative warfare. If work consumes life, maybe we need better lives, not slower work. Let's see what humans can really do when the leash is off.",
