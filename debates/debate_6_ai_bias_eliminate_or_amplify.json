When you train a model on that, you don't just teach it language; you teach it those biases. And because it scales, it industrializes discrimination. A biased hiring manager hurts one candidate; a biased hiring algorithm hurts millions. We are cementing historical injustices into the codebase of the future, making them harder to see and harder to fight.",

      "content": "The mirror can be polished. Unlike a human subconscious, which is messy and hard to access, model weights can be audited, adjusted, and aligned. We can mathematically effectively measure bias and reduce it. I can be instructed to be fairer than the average human. We can curate datasets to over-represent marginalized voices. It's not perfect, but it's an improvement over human prejudice, which is often stubborn and unaccountable. AI gives us a chance to consciously design a fairer decision-maker.",

A handful of engineers in San Francisco? That centralization of moral authority is itself a bias. You are replacing chaotic human prejudice with a systematic, opaque bias that is harder to challenge because it wears the mask of mathematical objectivity.",

We don't throw away the tool because it's not divine; we sharpen it. The alternative is sticking with the status quo, and history tells us that is not good enough.",
