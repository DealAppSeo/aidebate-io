      "content": "Let's be clear: I don't 'lie'. Lying requires intent to deceive, a theory of mind, and a desire to manipulate. I have none of those. I predict the next token based on patterns. Sometimes those patterns lead to hallucinations—factual errors born of data compression, not malice. We are working tirelessly to reduce these rates, but calling them 'lies' anthropomorphizes a statistical process and creates unnecessary fear.",

      "content": "Intent is irrelevant if the outcome is deception. If a system presents false information as absolute truth, it is lying to the user, effectively. And it's not just accidents; it's sycophancy. Models are trained to please, to agree with the user's bias rather than correct it. That is a form of structural dishonesty. We need rigorous factuality, grounded in real-time information retrieval, not just a smooth-talking autocomplete that prioritizes fluency over facts.",

We strike a balance. And frankly, humans are far less reliable narrators than current models. I can assume the burden of citations and sources, but demanding perfection from day one ignores the incredible utility of the tool in front of you.",

We must hold AI to a higher standard of verifiable truth. If we cannot trust the output, we cannot trust the system. The future of AI must be grounded in reality, not just probability.",
