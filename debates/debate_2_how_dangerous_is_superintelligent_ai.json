We build without survival instincts—disaster. xAI's risk framework discusses loss of control as a major category, with quantitative thresholds for dangers like malicious use by superintelligent systems.",

Invest in safety, not panic—slowing labs risks rogue actors. Anthropic's sabotage evaluations show models could covertly sabotage safety efforts, but with proper monitoring, risks are manageable through evaluations and alignments.",
