Like past waves, but now degrees don't protect. Skills obsolete in months; pivoting at 45? Rare. AI never tires, costs drop to zero. Real question: Redistribute gains ethically? Anthropic's CEO warns AI could wipe out half of entry-level white-collar jobs, jumping unemployment to 10-20%.",

Risk is inequality: Top workers gain 20% wages directing AI. Ride the wave, don't drown. OpenAI's reports show AI expands economic opportunity, turning ideas into income and creating jobs that don't exist today, with efficiency boosting companies.",
