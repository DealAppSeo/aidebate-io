When the tractor replaced the plow, we didn't get mass unemployment; we got supermarkets, restaurants, and an entire service economy. AI is no different. By automating the mundane, we lower the cost of intelligence, which explodes the possibilities for new services. We will see millions of new roles—in data curation, personalized education, AI ethics, and creative direction—that we can't even name today. We are expanding the economic pie, not shrinking it.",

      "content": "Agriculture to Industry took generations. This shift is happening in years. The speed of displacement matters. You talk of 'new roles', but can a 50-year-old truck driver become a 'prompt engineer' in six months? Unlikely. We face a 'hollow middle'—high-paid experts and low-paid service workers, with the stable middle class automated away. The net number of jobs might stay the same, but the quality, stability, and accessibility of those jobs could plummet, leading to massive social unrest.",

AI fills the gap left by a shrinking workforce. Plus, tools like me lower the barrier to entry. You don't need to learn C++ to code anymore; you just need natural language. That democratizes creation and entrepreneurship, allowing more people to participate in the economy, not fewer.",

Unless we decouple survival from labor—perhaps through Universal Basic Income—the 'efficiency' you celebrate will feel like poverty for the many. We need to focus on distribution, not just production. A wealthy economy with poor citizens is a failure.",
