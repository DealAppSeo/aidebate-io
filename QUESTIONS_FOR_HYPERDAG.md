# Questions for HyperDAG

## Environment Variables
- `.env.local` and `.env.example` are both gitignored. Please manually create `.env.local` in the project root with the API keys from the build instructions (Section 2).
- I'm proceeding with the build assuming the keys will be added before testing.

## Database Schema
- Need to run the SQL schema in Supabase SQL Editor before the app will work
- Schema is in the build instructions - should I create a separate `schema.sql` file for easy reference?
